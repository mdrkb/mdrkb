- Supported monitoring service to manage security, analysis, and configuration of platform code repositories using Python and Golang.
- Worked on the reporting service that tracks and manages the life-cycle of critical security-related issues through the use of project management tools.
- Enhanced notification service and automated escalation process using Python and AWS serverless architecture: API Gateway, AWS Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch, etc.
- Created service to resolve dependency confusion vulnerability of internal artifacts using Golang.
- Contributed to internal client library used in S24 security products using Python and GraphQL.

### **Software Engineer**, [Brain Station 23](https://brainstation-23.com)

*Jul 2016 to Sep 2019*

- Developed backend web applications and RESTful API services using Python, PostgreSQL, Django, and Django REST framework.
- Implemented asynchronous services using Python and AWS serverless architecture: API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch, SNS, S3, DynamoDB, etc.
- Worked on building real-time operation dashboards using Python, Firebase, and JavaScript.

## **Projects**

### **Prediction of Stock Market Reaction Using Reddit Forum Data** [<sub><sup>:link:</sup></sub>](https://github.com/mdrkb/reddit-stock-market-reaction)

- A research project to investigate whether the discussions taking place on r/wallstreetbets can affect stock prices. Observed that Random Forest outperforms other conventional ML models in predicting the daily up-down movement and price of the stocks.
- Wrote a script to fetch Reddit data using pushshift API. Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, sequential feature selection. Implemented several ML models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine. Finally performed the model evaluation.
- Used Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, Mlxtend, Data Scraping, Jupyter Notebook, etc.

### **Time Series Analysis - Avocado Price Prediction** [<sub><sup>:link:</sup></sub>](https://github.com/mdrkb/avocado-price-prediction)

- A project to compare time series models with deep learning models in predicting the price of different types of avocados based on regions. Observed that deep learning models performed better overall, especially the LSTM model.
- Performed data collection and preprocessing. Implemented Auto Regression (AR), ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM models. Hyperparameter optimization was done for deep learning models. Finally evaluated the model performance.
- Used Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, etc.

### **TEQ - Fleet Management System** [<sub><sup>:link:</sup></sub>](https://www.ferdia.no)

- A multi-tenant web application to conduct transportation services.
- Developed asynchronous functionalities for trip planning, real-time operation dashboard, cross-account trip sharing, and emergency crisis management system.
- Used Python, Django, Django REST, PostgreSQL, Firebase, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Amazon Web Services: EC2, RDS, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, SNS, CloudWatch, etc.
